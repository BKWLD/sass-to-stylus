# Sass â†’ Stylus

Convert a project's sass files to stylus files.  For now, a lot of the logic is hardcoded.  For instance, it expects the sass to live at app/sass and to get rewritten to app/styles.

Use an argument of ``--save` to save it out.  It outputs a nice diff.

`$ coffee sass-to-stylus --save`
